A Flutter implementation of Firebase auth. Sign In with Email and Password. <br>
I made this for an interview, with a timespan of 3 days.

## Getting Started

A few steps to get you started:
1. Open up your code in VSCode.
2. It should update the pub dependencies or if it doesn't you can just run `flutter pub get`
3. Then `flutter run` to build a dev apk on your phone and debug it.
